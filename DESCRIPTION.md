# Project Description

## Overview
**Bunny is on Farm** is an innovative game that combines farming simulation with dungeon exploration, featuring a bunny as the main character. The game invites players into a world where they must balance between tending to their farm, planting crops, harvesting resources, and exploring randomly generated dungeons. The game mechanics are inspired by **Stardew Valley**, but with an enhanced focus on dungeon exploration, puzzle-solving, and combat against animated enemies. Players will navigate through maze-like dungeons, engage in resource management, and combat enemies in dynamic, procedural environments. The core of the game is to expand the farm and survive the dungeon challenges.

### Key Features:
- **Farming System**: Grow crops, manage soil conditions, and harvest resources for profit.
 **Maze Exploration**: Navigate randomly generated mazes.
- **Dungeon Exploration**: Engage in battles with objects.

## Concept
The game consists of two primary mechanics:

### 1. **Farming**:
Players can:
- **Plant crops**: Different crops require different growth cycles, water levels, and maintenance.
- **Harvest crops**: Once matured, crops can be harvested and sold for profit to upgrade the farm or enter new dungeons.
- **Manage farm**: Players must ensure proper care of their crops, tending to soil conditions, and maintaining resources.

### 2. **Dungeon Exploration**:
Players will explore **dungeons**, filled with different **puzzles** and **combat challenges**:
- **Maze puzzles**: Navigate through complicated mazes with hidden exits and traps.
- **Combat zones**: Fight against animated objects like possessed farming tools, magical rocks, and more.
- **Loot gathering**: Collect special items and resources from the dungeons that can be used for farming upgrades or combat items.
